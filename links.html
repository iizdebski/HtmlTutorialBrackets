<p id="monkey">There are currently 264 known monkey species.

Monkeys can be divided into two groups, Old World monkeys that live in Africa and Asia, and New World monkeys that live in South America.
A baboon is an example of an Old World monkey, while a marmoset is an example of a New World monkey.
Apes are not monkeys.
Some monkeys live on the ground, while others live in trees.
Different monkey species eat a variety of foods, such as fruit, insects, flowers, leaves and reptiles.
Most monkeys have tails.
Groups of monkeys are known as a ‘tribe’, ‘troop’ or ‘mission’.
The Pygmy Marmoset is the smallest type of monkey, with adults weighing between 120 and 140 grams.
The Mandrill is the largest type of monkey, with adult males weighing up to 35 kg.
Capuchin monkeys are believed to be one of the smartest New World monkey species. They have the ability to use tools, learn new skills and show various signs of self-awareness.
Spider monkeys get their name because of their long arms, legs and tail. The monkey is the 9th animal that appears on the Chinese zodiac, 
appearing as the zodiac sign in 2016.</p>        

    <p id="location"> It has been estimated that human and dog have lived together happily for between 2,000 and 3,000 years. However, although historical sources do not provide a precise date, it is widely believed that the domestication process of wolves began between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago[1]. This is because wolves are the ancestors of current domestic dogs, changing both physically and psychologically over this time to become friendly pets.</p>

<p id="zodiac"> Many of the most popular dog breeds today emerge from the 18th and 19th centuries, breeds such as the German Shepherd or Boxer dog. Surprisingly, however, some breeds have survived thousands of years and evolved alongside humanity, maintaining certain original features in their appearance and character. AnimalWised invites you to meet the 18 oldest dog breeds in the world according to scientific research and reveals a little more about their origins.</p>
